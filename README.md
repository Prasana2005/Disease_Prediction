Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. 
It takes input symptoms and outputs the most likely disease, helping in early diagnosis. 
The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be further improved with more data and advanced techniques.
